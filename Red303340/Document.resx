    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

"must" and "must not" are NOT allowed in ETSI deliverables except when used in direct citation.
 


 
1	Scope

The present document applies to digital terrestrial television broadcast receivers fitted with an external antenna input (tuner port) capable of receiving DVB-T and/or DVB-T2 signals. Receivers without external antenna connectors, receivers with diversity, and receivers intended for mobile or automotive reception are not covered by the present document.

The present document contains the requirements for digital terrestrial television broadcast receivers to meet the essential requirements of article 3.2 of Directive 2014/53/EU [i.3] that radio equipment both effectively uses and supports the efficient use of radio spectrum in order to avoid harmful interference.

The present document includes considerations of interference from LTE transmissions in the 700 MHz and 800 MHz bands and DTT transmissions in UHF band IV. The requirements of the installation system (antenna, feeder cable, amplifiers, etc.) are not addressed.

Table 1: Broadcast frequency bands

Broadcast frequency bands
VHF III
UHF IV and V

There are country specific variations of frequency usage for digital terrestrial television reception and other users such as mobile broadband.

The tests in the present document only apply if the DTT broadcast receiver supports the wanted signal configuration used by the test in question. The applicable tests are summarized in annex E, table E.1.

3	Definitions, symbols, and abbreviations

3.1	Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions apply:

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR): ratio of the on-channel transmit power to the power measured in one of the adjacent channels with no active channel in the adjacent channel

NOTE:	In the present document this definition also applies to an unwanted signal at a specified frequency offset in a non-adjacent channel.

adjacent channel selectivity: measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a wanted modulated signal without exceeding a given degradation due to the presence of an unwanted signal which differs in frequency from the wanted signal by an amount equal to the adjacent channel separation for which the equipment is intended

NOTE 1: In the present document adjacent channel selectivity is determined by the onset of picture degradation.

NOTE 2: The interference power I is equal to the licensed power of the interferer. This definition does not have the same meaning as the term "Adjacent Channel Selectivity" (ACS) used in other organizations such as ITU, CEPT, and in co-existence studies. The adjacent channel selectivity in the present document is equivalent to the measured I/C ratio.
 

NOTE 3: In the present document this definition also applies to an unwanted signal at a specified frequency offset in a non-adjacent channel.

blocking or desensitization: measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a wanted modulated signal without exceeding a given degradation due to the presence of an unwanted signal at any frequency other than those of the spurious responses or of the adjacent channels

NOTE 1:  In the present document receiver blocking is determined by the onset of picture degradation.
NOTE 2: The wanted signal level in the blocking tests of the present document is set at the specified receiver sensitivity level plus 6 dB.

broadcast receiver: digital terrestrial television broadcast receiver comprising of at least a tuner and demodulator

broadcast receiver tuner port: DTT receiver tuner RF input connector

licensed power: highest rms power of the active portions of the signal measured over a specific time period
NOTE:	In the case of interference power measurements, this is the reference power used for I/C calculations in the present document. Typically for cases of LTE interference, this power is measured with a spectrum analyser in zero span with a gated power measurement function and rms detector over a period equal to an LTE symbol time. Alternatively it can be calculated by measuring the long term rms power and adding the appropriate LAPR from table 5.

long term rms power: rms power of the signal measured over a period long enough to smooth out any fluctuations in the signal power over time such as those due to transmission bursts

NOTE: This can be measured on an average power meter with an input filter time constant set high enough to average out fluctuations in the measured signal power or alternatively using a spectrum analyser with settings shown in table D.1.

onset of picture degradation: minimum time between successive errors in the displayed video is 15 seconds

radio equipment: product or relevant component thereof capable of communication by means of the emission and/or reception of radio waves utilizing the spectrum allocated to terrestrial/space radio communication

NOTE:	For the purposes of the present document the radio equipment is a digital terrestrial television broadcast receiver comprising of at least a tuner and demodulator.

receiver overloading: interfering signal level expressed in dBm, above which the receiver begins to lose its ability to discriminate against interfering signals at frequencies differing from that of the wanted signal due to the onset of strong non-linear behaviour
NOTE 1:  In the present document the overload level is determined by the onset of picture degradation.

NOTE 2: Above the overloading level the receiver will behave in a non-linear way, but does not necessarily fail immediately depending on the receiver and interference characteristics.

sensitivity: maximum usable sensitivity is defined as the minimum receiver Radio Frequency (RF) input signal level or field strength able to produce a specified analogue SINAD ratio or Bit Error Ratio (BER), or other specified output performance which depends on this input signal level

NOTE:	In the present document receiver sensitivity is determined by the onset of picture degradation.

4.2.2	Interference and wanted test signals
Three LTE waveforms with 10 MHz bandwidth are used in the present document as interference sources for the receiver conformance specification and tests. These waveforms are based on recordings from LTE BS and UE equipment which have been converted into a suitable format for replay on laboratory vector signal generators. Two of these waveforms have been selected because they are known to exercise the operation of DTT receiver automatic gain control (AGC) systems which is a key area for receiver performance optimization. In particular tests using the UE waveform may require receiver optimization. These waveforms are contained in archive en_303340v010102p0.zip which accompanies the present document. More waveform details are given in annex B.
The wanted DVB-T and DVB-T2 test signals shall carry a video stream containing moving images and an audio signal. Recommendation ITU-R BT.1729 test signal [i.10] may be used.

4.2.3	Sensitivity

4.2.3.1	Definition
The maximum usable sensitivity is defined as the minimum receiver Radio Frequency (RF) input signal level or field strength able to produce a specified analogue SINAD ratio or Bit Error Ratio (BER), or other specified output performance which depends on this input signal level. In the present document receiver sensitivity is determined by the onset of picture degradation.

4.2.3.2	Method of Measurement

4.2.3.2.1	Test arrangement description
The test arrangement is shown in figure 1.

4.2.3.2.2	Test procedure
The steps of the test procedure are given below:

a)	The wanted signal, provided by signal generator-C, shall be set to the wanted signal frequency as shown in table 4 and configured with the appropriate DTT mode parameters (tables 2 and 3).

b)	Determine the attenuation of the cables, splitters, 50/75 ohm matching pad.
c)	Set the level of the wanted signal C at the broadcast receiver tuner port to -50 dBm and note the value of the "attenuator C" (= AC1).
d)	Tune the DTT receiver to the wanted channel.

e)	Increase the "attenuator C" sufficiently to cause complete picture failure.

f)	Adjust "attenuator C" gradually until the onset of picture degradation occurs. Force the receiver under test to re-acquire and re-adjust "attenuator C" until the onset of picture degradation occurs. Note the attenuator setting (= AC2).
g)	The receiver sensitivity shall be recorded in the measurement record (table C.1) as:
-50 - (AC2 - AC1) dBm	(1)
 

h)	Repeat step a) to g) for the remaining frequencies in table 4.

4.2.3.3	Limits
The sensitivity limits are shown in table 4. The equipment shall be tested in its normal operating mode.

NOTE 1:   For applicability of tests see annex E.
NOTE 2: Measurement studies of typical performance show measured sensitivity could be 6 dB better, however the limits above allow for manufacturing tolerance and measurement uncertainty.


4.2.4	Adjacent channel selectivity

4.2.4.1	Definition
In the present document, adjacent channel selectivity (I/C) is defined as the measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a wanted modulated signal without exceeding a given degradation due to the presence of an unwanted signal which differs in frequency from the wanted signal by an amount equal to the adjacent channel separation for which the equipment is intended. In the present document adjacent channel selectivity is determined by the onset of picture degradation.

NOTE 1: The interference power I is equal to the licensed power of the interferer. This definition does not have the same meaning as the term "Adjacent Channel Selectivity" (ACS) used in other organizations such as ITU, CEPT, and in co-existence studies. The adjacent channel selectivity in the present document is equivalent to the measured I/C ratio.

NOTE 2: In the present document this definition also applies to an unwanted signal at a specified frequency offset in a non-adjacent channel.
 

4.2.4.2	Method of Measurement

4.2.4.2.1	Test arrangement description
The basic measurement arrangement is shown in the top half of figure 2. Other arrangements may also be used - for example a widely deployed test configuration shown at the bottom of figure 2 uses a single item of test equipment that combines generator C and generator I. Some signal generators include precision RF attenuators which can be used in place of "attenuator I" and "attenuator C". Some generators have an optimum output power level where the ACLR is at a maximum and in these circumstances it may be preferable to use external attenuators to maintain the optimum ACLR over the interference power level used for the test.

Additional information on the optional elements of the test arrangement, measurement techniques, recommended instrument settings are given in annex D.

4.2.4.2.2	Requirements for the ACLR of the interfering signal
See annex F.

4.2.4.2.3	Test procedure
a)	Two signal generators, I and C, shall be connected to the receiver via a combining network.

b)	Determine the attenuation of the cables, combiner, splitter and 50/75 ohm matching pad.

c)	The wanted signal, provided by signal generator C, shall be set to the wanted signal frequency C as shown in table 5 and configured with the appropriate DTT mode parameters (tables 2 and 3). Turn this generator off (or to at least 30 dBc below the interferer signal) maintaining output impedance.

d)	The unwanted signal I, provided by signal generator I, shall be configured with the required interferer waveform and interferer signal frequency as shown in table 5.

e)	The unwanted signal power at the broadcast receiver tuner port shall be set to the rms interferer power Irms in table 5. This power shall be verified with the power meter or spectrum analyser. Recommended instrument settings are described in clause D.2.

f)	Turn on signal generator C and adjust "attenuator C" so that the rms powers of the interferer I and wanted signal C are equal. Note this attenuator setting (= AC1).
g)	Tune the DTT receiver to the wanted channel.

h)	Increase "attenuator C" in 1 dB steps or less until the onset of picture degradation occurs (see clause 3.1 for definition). Force the receiver under test to re-acquire and re-adjust "attenuator C" until the onset of picture degradation occurs. Note the attenuator setting (= AC2).
i)	The adjacent channel selectivity (I/C) shall be recorded in the measurement record (table C.2) as AC2-AC1 + LAPR dB, where LAPR is the licensed to average power ratio shown in table 5. Alternatively the measured wanted signal power C shall be recorded in the measurement record (table C.2) as Irms - (AC2 - AC1) dBm.
j)	Repeat step b) to i) for the remaining tests in table 5.

4.2.5	Blocking

4.2.5.1	Definition
The measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a wanted modulated signal without exceeding a given degradation due to the presence of an unwanted signal at any frequency other than those of the spurious responses or of the adjacent channels. In the present document receiver blocking is determined by the onset of picture degradation.

NOTE:	The wanted signal level in the blocking tests of the present document is fixed at the specified receiver sensitivity level plus 6 dB.

4.2.5.2.1	Test arrangement description
See clause 4.2.4.2.1.

4.2.5.2.2	Requirements for the ACLR of the interfering signal

The interference signal I is a fully loaded LTE-BS signal with 10 MHz channel bandwidth.

4.2.5.2.3	Test procedure
a)	Two signal generators, I and C, shall be connected to the receiver via a combining network.

NOTE 4: For the purposes of this test, the value of Irms is approximately equivalent to Ilic, given that the LTE BS interferer signal is fully loaded.


4.2.6	Overloading

4.2.6.1	Definition
Overloading is the interfering signal level expressed in dBm, above which the receiver begins to lose its ability to discriminate against interfering signals at frequencies differing from that of the wanted signal due to the onset of strong non-linear behaviour. In the present document the overload level is determined by the onset of picture degradation.

NOTE:	Above the overloading level the receiver will behave in a non-linear way, but does not necessarily fail immediately depending on the receiver and interference characteristics.

Annex B (informative): Summary of study work

B.1	Overview
The present document focuses on the requirements to handle the most likely sources of interference to digital terrestrial television (DTT) receivers following the first and second digital dividends. In particular the working group study has concentrated on stimulating good receiver behaviour in the presence of bursty interference signals, such as from LTE user equipment (UE) which is important for the deployment of LTE 700 MHz services because the UE transmissions starting at 703 MHz (channel edge) are only 9 MHz away from the top edge of DTT channel 48 (694 MHz)
(figure B.1). This can be compared to the LTE 800 MHz situation where the UE transmissions are separated from DTT channel 60 by 42 MHz (figure B.2).

The study has focused on fixed rooftop reception of DTT using standard antennas without amplification. Interference immunity specifications for external amplifiers such as mast head amplifiers, booster amplifiers, distribution amplifiers and amplified antennas used with portable receivers are outside the scope of the present document.

The result of the study is a specification including tests for receiver performance against interference from LTE 800 MHz BS, LTE 700 MHz BS, and LTE 700 MHz UE, using as interfering sources, representative bursty LTE waveforms based on recordings from LTE BS and UE equipment. These specifications were based on statistical
analysis of 26 DTT receiver tests for LTE 700 MHz and 37 DTT receiver tests for LTE 800 MHz interference made on recent DVB-T/T2 receiver designs and tuner silicon. The receivers tested were dated between 2012 and 2015 and a high proportion of these receivers already conformed to existing DTG and Nordig specifications.



Figure B.1: Example spectrum plan for LTE 700 MHz



Figure B.2: Example spectrum plan for LTE 800 MHz


B.2	Selection of interferer waveforms

B.2.1	UE waveform
The LTE UE signal is typically more bursty than base station (BS) signals due to the likelihood of occasional transmitted bursts from a single user separated by long gaps, rather than frequent bursts (including regular pilot reference symbols) to multiple users from a BS. It is this bursty characteristic of the UE signal that can be particularly challenging to DTT receiver automatic gain control (AGC) operation and this was identified as a potential area of receiver improvement that could be stimulated by setting appropriate conformance tests in the present document using a suitable UE interference signal.
 

Several different 10 MHz LTE UE signals with different traffic loads were recorded whilst connected to a live LTE 800 MHz network. These signals were replayed in laboratory tests at the most critical co-existence frequency of 708 MHz to measure the performance of a range of modern DTT receivers (up to 3 years old) operating on channel
48 (690 MHz) (9 MHz guard band). From those early tests the "short_UE-Video-Stream_V2" waveform was selected as the most appropriate interferer signal for more extensive receiver testing for the following reasons:

•	It was a signal representative of terminal traffic from a real video streaming application.
•	It was a signal carried by a real mobile network LTE-800.
•	It was a signal representative of that from modern 4G smart phones.
•	It was a repetitive signal that could be truncated in a valid way to facilitate rapid testing (truncated to 1 second approximately).

•	It was an LTE signal with particularly challenging characteristics for measured DTT receivers whose testing would lead to significant improvement in the presence of LTE interference.
The time domain plot of this waveform is shown in figure B.3. The regular bursts of activity are separated by one second gaps with some low level background traffic from the UE operating system.

The "short_UE-Video-Stream_V2" waveform has been converted into a popular signal generator format for receiver testing purposes. The file header has been adjusted to display the licensed power rather than the rms power on the signal generator for convenience in testing.

B.2.2	BS waveforms
For the base station tests, the "LTE_BS_idle_V3_synth" waveform specified in the present document was synthesized from the existing so called "LTE_BS_idle" recorded waveform which is widely known to challenge the AGCs of DTT receivers. The synthesized version has similar time and frequency domain characteristics to the existing "LTE_BS_idle" waveform and gives similar receiver adjacent channel selectivity results, but has the advantage of being available to ETSI for use with the present document. Other improvements in the synthesized waveform include the removal of an artefact, the file length trimmed to a whole number of LTE symbols and the file header adjusted to display the licensed power on the signal generator rather than the rms power for convenience in testing. Figure B.4 shows a 50 ms section of this waveform which largely consists of pilot reference symbols plus some occasional short data bursts. Figure B.5 shows a swept frequency plot of this waveform. More correctly this waveform could be termed "near idle" rather than true idle where no data is sent.
 

For the blocking and overloading tests, the "LTE_BS-100PC_synth" waveform specified in the present document was synthesized from the existing so called "LTE_BS-100PC recorded waveform. This is a fully loaded LTE base station signal with a 10 MHz bandwidth. Figure B.6 shows a 50 ms section of this waveform and figure B.7 shows a swept frequency plot of this waveform.

Both these waveforms have been converted into a popular signal generator format for receiver testing purposes and support for other signal generator formats is planned.

B.3	Reception conditions for LTE UE 700 MHz interference

B.3.1	Calculation of maximum coupling gain
Figure B.8 shows the standard reference geometry model used to derive the received UE interference level at the DTT receiver input using a fixed rooftop antenna, taken from clause A.2.1.1 of ECC Report 186 [i.9] using a frequency of 650 MHz. This model uses Recommendation ITU-R BT.419-3 [i.12] template antenna with a 9,15 dBi gain (including feeder cable loss).
 



   
Figure B.8: Reference model for coupling gain

The maximum theoretical coupling gain GC between the UE at 1,5 m height and the broadcast receiver tuner port taking account of the vertical DTT receive antenna pattern, the maximum loss and receive antenna discrimination from the UE to the DTT antenna is -56,15 - 0,45 dB + 9,15 = -47,45 dB at 650 MHz, or -48,24 dB at 708 MHz. This maximum gain was achieved at a horizontal separation of 22 m. Higher horizontal separations result in a higher propagation losses and lower separations take the UE out of the antenna bore sight, both resulting in lower coupling gains. Similar theoretical coupling gains were calculated in [i.2] along with field measurements of coupling gains using different antenna types.

B.3.2	Calculation of maximum received UE interference power
The LTE UE transmitted power was taken to be PUE = 23 dBm E.I.R.P.

Therefore the maximum received UE interference power (PRX_UE) at the broadcast receiver tuner port was estimated to be:

PRX_UE	= PUE - GC
= 23 dBm - 48,24 dB

= -25,24 dBm at 708 MHz
Thus a received UE interference power of -25 dBm was used for conformance tests in the present document as the worst case UE interference power level likely to be received on the broadcast receiver tuner port via a rooftop antenna. Typical received UE interference levels are likely to be lower than this figure.


B.4	Choice of BS interference power in receiver tests

The interference test levels were a pragmatic choice, based on the highest signal level that can be tolerated by current DTT receiver designs (including some safety margin). This is particularly relevant for some DTT receiver products where a high gain preamplifier and signal splitter is needed to achieve a low noise figure in each tuner, but this high gain preamplifier is naturally more sensitive to high level interference.

Annex D (informative):
Additional information to assist measurements

D.1	Optional elements of the test arrangement
Optional elements of the test arrangement described in figure 2 are greyed out such as a computer controller to partially automate the control of test equipment. Other optional elements include an RF isolator to avoid the strong interferer signal affecting the wanted signal generator, and various filter options (see inset of figure 2) to improve the ACLR of the interference generator so as to obtain the best performance from the receiver under test. It is not necessary to permanently connect the power meter/spectrum analyser whilst the receiver measurement is being made, thus eliminating the need for the splitter. It is possible to use a 75	power meter to avoid the splitter shown in figure 2.


D.2	Instrument settings for measuring the power of bursty interference signals
The selectivity tests in clause 4.2.4 require measuring the long term rms power of bursty signals. Long term rms power measurements can be made using an average power sensor plus power meter with an input filter time constant set high enough to smooth out the fluctuations in the bursty interferer signal. Alternatively the power may be measured using a spectrum analyser in zero span or swept frequency mode. Recommended settings for measuring the long term rms power of the interference signal are shown in table D.1.

D.3	Improving ACLR

In the present document the term ACLR applies to the measurements of an unwanted signal in an adjacent or non- adjacent channel according to the specified frequencies of the wanted and unwanted signals of the test.

Achieving adequate ACLR on wideband interference test signals is important to reduce the impact on I/C measurements. The ideal configuration uses separate signal generators for the wanted and interferer signals which also allow a band pass filter to be added to the interference path to improve the ACLR further as shown in figure 2 of the present document.

The ACLR improvement filter may be a manually variable band pass filter (a), or a computer programmable band pass filter (b). Best performance can be achieved by offsetting the filter slightly over the interferer signal to maximize the attenuation of out of band components falling into the wanted channel. A typical band pass filter suitable for improving ACLR is a 5 section variable band pass filter which is commercially available in both manually tuneable and computer controlled variants. This has a 5 % 3 dB bandwidth and a shape factor of 2,2:1 for 30 dB to 3 dB, and 3,5:1 for 50 dB to 3 dB. An example filter response is shown in figure D.1 where the filter can improve the ACLR of the signal generator by 65,57 dB for test 2 (clause 4.2.4.3, table 5).

Figure D.1: Frequency response of band pass filter used for ACLR improvement
Another option (c) in figure 2 uses fixed frequency notch filters centred on the wanted channels to reduce the out of band components of the interferer. A filter bypass may be needed for adjacent channel selectivity test 1 where the interferer and wanted signals are close together in frequency (see clause 4.2.4.3 table 5) if the Ch60 notch filter attenuates the lower edge of the BS interferer spectrum at 791 MHz.

Signal generators often include precision RF attenuators which can be used in place of "attenuator I" and "attenuator C" in figure 2. However some generators have an optimum output power level where the ACLR is maximized and in these circumstances it may be preferable to set the interferer to this optimum power level and then use external attenuators to maintain the optimum ACLR over all interference power levels of the test.


D.4	Measuring ACLR

The ACLR measurement can be limited by the spectrum analyser dynamic range, particularly if the ACLR is being improved by the use of a band pass filter. ACLR measurements can be degraded by overloading the spectrum analyser input or by using low signal levels where the spectrum analyser noise floor will limit measurements. The noise correlation function in some spectrum analysers can reduce the effects of analyser noise and improve the ACLR measurement. Optimizing the input attenuator setting, using long sweep times and using an adequate number of points can also be beneficial.

The combined generator plus filter ACLR can easily exceed the dynamic range of the spectrum analyser. In this case the total ACLR can be determined in two steps:

1)	The filter's ACLR contribution can be measured over the band of interest using a wide band noise generator as the input source.
2)	The measured filter ACLR can then be added to the measured ACLR of the generator itself.
